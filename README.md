# Movie Genre Recomendation Machine Learning Model
## **Introduction**
A machine learning model is developed for recommendation of movie genre based on the data set obatined from the film reviews having attributes:
1. **Age** : Age of the film reviewer.
2. **Gender** : Gender of the data. reviewer.
3. **Actor** : Lead actor of the film.
4. **Actress** : Lead actress of the film.
5. **Director** : Director of the film.
